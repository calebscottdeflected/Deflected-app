# Deflected-app
Deflected is a new version of the old game pong, still buggy, but it will work. The game has 4 paddles you have to control and try to keep the ball in the center for as long as you can. In the app you can buy different colors for the ball. This is the file of deflected on the app store I challange you to beat my high score of 86.
